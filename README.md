# author-child

![Screenshot of the Author Child theme](screenshot.png)

A child theme of [Author by Compete Themes](https://github.com/BenSibley/Author). This only contains a subset of the Font Awesome icons relevant to me. The icons that are loaded can be adjusted in the `build.js` file.

## Building

To build this project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci
# Build the theme
npm run build
```

## SASS Folder

I do not intend to edit any sass files except for the `style.scss` file and the `_variables.scss` file. Other customizations will be placed in the `_child_theme.scss` file.
